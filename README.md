# **GoNovels** - barebones novel hosting webserver

## **PROJECT IS STILL NOT FUNCTIONAL**

This project is not meant to be a fully flashed out novel hosting service with acounts.

The objective here is to provide a simple way to host your personal novel collection. Be it (ideally) your own, self-written, web-novels or perhaps a collection of some other novels (if you care enough to port it to markdown).

I got the idea to do it because I like writing funny things for fun sometimes and I didn't really wish to use other services (like Wattpad, ew) to upload my works.

if you care enough to read the slop I have written (or more likely you just want to see how the site looks/functions) it is (should be at least) available at:

[novels.farima4.space](https://novels.farima4.space)



## Rough explanation of how it works:

This project doesn't use a database.

In the root directory of the project is a *novels* folder. inside of it you are supposed to place your novels, each saparated in to a different folder.
(note: The *novels* folder for now has to stay in the root directory, I might add the ability to point to a different path later, for example *Documents/novels*)
(note: I will provide an example novel with the project by default to understand it easier)

How you name the folder doesn't matter but you should keep the folder names the same as the novel names for your own sake.

So create a folder *novels/my-first-novel*

inside the *my-first-novel* folder the most important file to create is *metadata.json*

**will write the rest of readme later**
